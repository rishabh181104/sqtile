### `scripts/ref-dunst`

Refreshes the Dunst configuration by replacing placeholders with colors generated by `pywal`, killing any existing Dunst processes, and restarting Dunst.

### `scripts/security-validation`

Validates the security hardening measures implemented on the system. It checks various aspects of security and provides a summary report with recommendations.

### `scripts/setup-git`

Automates the process of setting up Git with SSH authentication for GitHub, including:

*   Generating an RSA SSH key with a passphrase.
*   Copying the public key to the clipboard.
*   Updating the remote URL to use SSH.
*   Configuring the SSH agent in the Zsh configuration file.

*   Creating and enrolling Secure Boot keys.
*   Setting up pacman hooks to automatically sign the kernel and bootloader after updates.
*   Setting up kernel module signing.
*   Generating and signing a Unified Kernel Image (UKI).

### `scripts/user-hardening`

Focuses on hardening the user environment, including:

*   Configuring secure shell settings.
*   Setting up SSH client configuration.
*   Configuring GPG.
*   Setting up Git security.
*   Configuring privacy environment variables.
*   Hardening Firefox.
*   Installing user-space security tools.
*   Setting up Firejail profiles for application sandboxing.
*   Creating user monitoring tools.

### `scripts/wset`

Allows the user to select a wallpaper from the `$HOME/Wallpapers/Pictures` directory using `rofi` and then sets the selected wallpaper using the `wset-backend` script.

### `scripts/wset-backend`

Sets the wallpaper and updates the system's color scheme using `wal`. It also reloads the Qtile configuration and refreshes the Dunst configuration.

## Usage

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd sqtile
    ```

2.  Make the scripts executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/*
    ```

3.  Run the scripts as needed. Some scripts require root privileges and should be run with `sudo`.

## Configuration

*   Most scripts are designed to be run as-is, but some may require customization based on your specific needs.
*   The `arch-hardening` script provides a comprehensive set of security configurations. Review the script and adjust the settings as needed.
*   The `setup-git` script requires you to enter your GitHub username and repository name.
*   The `wset` script uses the `$HOME/Wallpapers/Pictures` directory for wallpapers. You can change this directory by modifying the script.

## Dependencies
